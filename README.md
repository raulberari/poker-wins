#Poker Wins

My way of solving [problem 54](https://projecteuler.net/problem=54) from Project Euler. The `numberOfPokerWins.cpp` file reads from `carti.txt` 
a number `n` succeeded by `n` lines of 10 cards each. The output in `poker.out` shows the visual representation of each
game and writes down the conclusion. 

To generate more tests, I wrote a simple Python script that writes an `n` number of games into `carti.txt`.
